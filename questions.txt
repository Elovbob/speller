checks whether length of a word[] is less than 45 letters by incrementing index every time it adds letter. Main also omits words 
that contain numeric symbols. Once it hits '\0' sign it stops adding letter to the string and treat it as a single word[]. Then main
checks whether the word[] is mispelled and goes on next word with the same procedure until it hits EOF.
